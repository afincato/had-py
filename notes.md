# Notes on learning some python while making the C and V for the M of the website

21.03.2017

Idea:
* went through all Django seven-part tutorial to understand what is the MVC pattern
* now build a tiny framework yourself using Python, by learning Python
* do everything in the terminal, use vi instead of another text-editor
* keep this file out of git (it's a personal journal, not the `readme.md`

1. Establish connection with media wike API
2. Fetch `json` data from url
3. Build classes or components or filter or speicific calls based on the json data to retrieve: eg., fetch intro text from article, fetch image and-or media element from article, fetch entire body text from article, fetch only titles from articles being tagged with x word and with start-date x, and so forth.

As James was saying, together with Anja and Joel we have to rethink, clean-up, give more structure to the content using tags (what wikimedia calls semantic formâ€”I think).
